<a id="title2"/><h1 class="title-part"><span class="b">THE DEVELOPMENT OF CAPITALISM IN RUSSIA</span></h1>
<p class="p-indent">In December 1895, Lenin and a number of his associates were arrested and imprisoned. Lenin spent more than a year in prison, during which he began his first major study, <span class="i">The Development of Capitalism in Russia.</span> Released from prison, Lenin was sent into exile in Siberia, where he completed the book. It was published legally in St. Petersburg in 1899 under the pseudonym “V. Ilin.” Lenin was still in Siberian exile when the book appeared; he was not permitted to return to European Russia until the following year.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The subtitle of this work is “The Process of Formation of the Home Market for Large-Scale Industry.” Lenin himself defined the scope of the book as follows: “First, as the title already shows, we take the question of the development of capitalism in Russia exclusively from the point of view of the home market and leave aside the question of the foreign market and data concerning foreign trade. Secondly, we limit ourselves only to the post-Reform period. Thirdly, we take principally and almost exclusively data on the home, purely Russian gubernias. Fourthly, we limit ourselves exclusively to the economic aspect of the process.”</p>
<p class="p-indent">Lenin’s immediate ideological goal in writing <span class="i">The Development of Capitalism in Russia</span> was to combat the economic theories of the Narodniki movement, the history and significance of which is discussed in the Introduction to the present volume.</p>
<p class="p-indent">Publication of <span class="i">The Development of Capitalism in Russia</span> brought into print various key Leninist concepts. First, Lenin argued that Marxist theory applied immediately and directly to the distinctive conditions and problems of Russia, thus challenging the Narodniki characterization of Russia as a unique case. Second, Lenin attacked the historic Narodniki orientation toward the peasantry, stressing instead the significance of the industrial proletariat as a revolutionary base. Third, Lenin assailed the Narodniki theory of a revolutionary transformation of Russia directly from an almost feudal society into a socialist one; Lenin asserted that capitalism was a necessary and even desirable transitional stage between feudalism and socialism.</p>
<p class="p-indent">The length of <span class="i">The Development of Capitalism in Russia</span> precludes a one-volume collection. Presented here, therefore, are the key excerpts in which Lenin himself sums up his conclusions.</p>
